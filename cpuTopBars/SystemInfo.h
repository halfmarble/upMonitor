// the host's, between the newest stored sample and the newest one at least 1 s older, less half a tick (an older one
// where the counters had not moved since), or -1 with fewer than two samples or no ticks in them; *span,
// when span is not NULL, gets the window's length in seconds (0 with -1). SystemInfoCpuReset forgets the samples
// (after a pause, so that a window never spans one).
