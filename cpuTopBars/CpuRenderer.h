// a bar with its charge written over it), Wi-Fi's signal (CPU_RENDER_SHOWN_WIFI), disk, memory, then a clear gap, then the Neural
// Engine's and the GPU's bar (CPU_RENDER_SHOWN_GPU, both), CPU, the E-cores' CPU and the P-cores' CPU. Which of the optional
// ones are drawn is a mask, shown, of CPU_RENDER_SHOWN_* bits, and each reading has a kind, CPU_RENDER_KIND_*; its index is
// the number of shown readings of earlier kinds (CpuRenderReadingIndex, CpuRenderReadingKind), each index one slot. The gap
// after memory is a group gap, 4 pt
// (5 in Dot style, after the last dot's overhang), and is there only when shown is not 0, so with none of the optional
// readings the block is as it was before them. When the graph splits into the E-cores' bars and then the P-cores' (efficiencyBars
// above 0, the count of the graph's bars that are E-cores', CpuRenderEfficiencyBars), the E-cores' and the P-cores' readings
// each head their own cores instead: the readings before them, the gap, the E-cores' reading and their bars, a group gap, the
// P-cores' reading and their bars; the image is a group gap wider (in Dot style 1 pt more, the last E-core dot's overhang). Any
// number of extra readings that a build adds are drawn in the same way at the right of the
// image, after the core graph and a gap as wide. The block's readings may be left out (extraOnly): the core graph then starts at x = 0, with the extra readings, when
// there are any, at the right as before. The extra readings fall into groups: a reading that starts a group is drawn
// after a further clear gap, CPU_RENDER_GROUP_GAP wide, and the first reading is always the first of its group. An
// extra reading may also carry a mark, a 1-pt line across its bar at that height, an alert, which draws its bar whole,
// without the dashes, a pace, how much of the bar's period has passed, and a tint, which paints its bar as a bar at
// another load would be, its fill opaque with colour, its height unchanged; with colour, the part of a bar above its
// pace, and all of an alert bar with no pace, is painted in its ramp's hottest colour. With none of the optional readings
